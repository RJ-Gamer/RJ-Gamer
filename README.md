I architect backend systems where **time, money, and data integrity are non-negotiable**.

My work focuses on platforms that must survive:

- regulatory scrutiny  
- financial impact  
- distributed failures  
- real-world operational chaos  

I design systems that are:

- **Deterministic** — same input, same output  
- **Explicit** — state machines over boolean flags  
- **Audit-safe** — defensible history, traceable intent  
- **Failure-aware** — idempotent, observable, recoverable

# 🎯 Core Domains

### 🏗 Backend Architecture
Django, DRF, FastAPI, PostgreSQL  
State modeling, schema evolution, constraint-driven design, API architecture

### 🔒 Compliance-Critical Systems
Payments, healthcare, scheduling, audit trails  
Transactional guarantees, event logging, actor attribution, system invariants

### 🤖 Production Machine Learning
ML system design, deployment, monitoring  
SageMaker, feature pipelines, model rollback strategies, ML as infrastructure

# 🚀 Open Source — Infrastructure-Focused Libraries

My open-source work eliminates hidden state and implicit behavior in Django ecosystems.

---

## 1️⃣ django-system-audit  
**Intent-aware audit trails for Django applications**

Designed for compliance-sensitive systems that must answer:

> Who did what, when, where, and why?

Core principles:
- Intent over inference  
- Explicit actor attribution  
- Deterministic event logging  
- No duplicate audit records  
- Async-safe context handling  

Use cases:
- Healthcare platforms  
- Fintech products  
- SaaS applications requiring defensible history  

---

## 2️⃣ django-ml-audit  
**Audit tracking for production ML workflows**

Bridges backend systems and machine learning pipelines.

Solves:
- Model version traceability  
- Prediction event tracking  
- Dataset lineage awareness  
- Reproducibility auditing  

Designed for:
- Regulated ML systems  
- Healthcare ML workflows  
- Decision-critical inference services  

Principle:
> ML systems are stateful infrastructure — not black-box functions.

---

## 3️⃣ timeblocks  
**Deterministic time block & recurrence engine for Django**

Built to eliminate:

- DST inconsistencies  
- Timezone drift  
- Recurrence logic bugs  
- Scheduling race conditions  

Design philosophy:
- Same input = same schedule  
- Database-enforced conflict prevention  
- Explicit recurrence modeling  

Applications:
- Appointment booking  
- Workforce scheduling  
- Resource allocation systems

# 💼 Architectural Impact

### Performance Engineering
Re-architected data access and indexing strategies — reducing API latency by ~60% while maintaining transactional correctness.

### Payment Systems
Designed idempotent Stripe integrations with explicit state transitions and failure-safe retries.

### Healthcare Platforms
Implemented audit-safe workflows aligned with compliance and traceability requirements.

### Team Leadership
Mentor 5+ backend engineers. Own architectural direction and production delivery.

**Current Role:** Senior Software Engineer @ Mindbowser Inc  
*Nov 2022 – Present*

🏆 “Going Above and Beyond” Award (Oct 2024)  
🤝 “Team Player” Award (Dec 2025)

# 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

I optimize for systems that survive contact with reality.

### Core Design Principles

- Database truth > service assumptions  
- Explicit state transitions > implicit side effects  
- Idempotency at every boundary  
- Fail loudly, log clearly, recover deterministically  
- Migrations without rewrites  

I treat ML components as **stateful system dependencies**, not magic functions.
