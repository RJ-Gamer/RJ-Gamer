# 👋 Hi, I’m Rajat Jog

Senior Software Engineer • Backend Architect • Python/Django Specialist  
I design **deterministic, scalable systems** where correctness, data integrity, and long-term evolution are non-negotiable.

## 🧠 How I Approach Software

I treat software systems like infrastructure, not experiments.

My default assumptions:
- Systems **will** be misused
- Edge cases **will** happen
- Time, money, and humans **will** break naive designs

So I optimize for:
- **Explicit models over implicit behavior**
- **State machines over boolean flags**
- **Database constraints over application hope**
- **Idempotency, auditability, and safety by design**

I’m not interested in “making it work.”  
I care about *why it works, when it fails, and how it can evolve without rewrites*.

## 🤖 Machine Learning (Production-Oriented)

I’m AWS Certified in **Machine Learning – Specialty**, with a focus on **designing, deploying, and operating ML systems in production**, not notebook-only models.

My ML work emphasizes:
- Selecting the **right ML approach** (or deciding when *not* to use ML)
- Designing **data pipelines** that prevent leakage and silent drift
- Training, evaluating, and tuning models with **business-aligned metrics**
- Deploying ML systems with:
  - versioned models
  - reproducible training
  - monitored inference
  - safe rollback paths

I’m particularly opinionated about:
- ML correctness > model complexity
- Clear separation between **training**, **validation**, and **inference**
- Treating ML components as **stateful system dependencies**, not magic functions
- Observability for ML (inputs, outputs, confidence, degradation)

In short:  
I think about ML the same way I think about backend systems — **explicit, testable, auditable, and failure-aware**.

## 🛠 Core Technical Stack

### Backend & Data
- Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL (schema design, constraints, indexing, migrations)
- Transactional workflows & background jobs
- Concurrency-safe operations and retries

### Frontend (System-Oriented)
- React, Next.js
- API-driven UI architecture
- Predictable state & data flow boundaries

### Architecture & Platform Concerns
- RESTful API design
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging & compliance-friendly systems
- Payments, booking engines, scheduling & slot modeling
- Timezone-aware, recurrence-safe designs

---

## 🧩 What I’m Particularly Strong At

- Designing **complex domain models**  
  (healthcare, booking, payments, scheduling, approvals)
- Translating vague requirements into **enforceable invariants**
- Preventing race conditions, double-spends, and ghost states
- Building systems that are:
  - safe to regenerate
  - easy to reason about
  - hard to misuse

If a system involves **time, money, concurrency, or trust** — that’s my comfort zone.

---

## 🧪 Engineering Principles I Default To

- Explicit state transitions over implicit side effects
- Database truth > service assumptions
- Idempotency everywhere it matters
- Fail loudly, log clearly, recover deterministically
- Documentation as part of the system, not an afterthought

---

## 📦 Open Source & Side Projects

I enjoy extracting real-world production patterns into reusable tools:

- Deterministic scheduling & time-block systems
- Audit logging & compliance-friendly utilities
- Django / DRF abstractions that reduce foot-guns for teams

My side projects usually start as **solutions to production pain**, not demos.

---

## 🚀 What I’m Building Toward

- Architect-level backend roles
- High-impact, correctness-first SaaS products
- Open-source tools teams can trust in production
- Systems that scale **organizationally**, not just technically
